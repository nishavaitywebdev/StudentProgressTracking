Hi,

I am pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University and I will be graduating in December 2017. I would like you to consider me for a Full-time work opportunity as a Software Engineer at Salesforce.

I take passion in Software development and I have been designing and developing web applications during my co-op, summer internship and during most of my semesters in my graduate coursework. I am working on building ‘Capstone Student Progress Tracking' web application using React as a Project course this semester. I am proficient with programming languages like Java, JavaScript and Python. I also have experience working with frameworks like AngularJS, Node.js and working knowledge of databases - MySQL, SQL Server and NoSQL Database - MongoDB. 

My aim is to further my knowledge and understanding of Software Design and I look at this opportunity as a chance to work with technically brilliant minds, to grow professionally and to put my technical skills to use and contribute towards building software products that make an impact on people and the way they use technology. If given an opportunity, I assure you that I would strive to make contribution to your organization to the best of my ability and to develop new skills and share my knowledge while interacting with others and achieve new heights.

Kindly refer to my resume.
Looking forward to hear from you positively at the earliest.
